What is this?
-------------

This blogpost continues where [the previous one] left off. Again, I study the
performance of an application using the [Data.Text] library intensively. The
difference is that this blogpost focuses almost exclusively on the memory usage
of the resulting application.

[the previous one]: /posts/2011-07-10-text-utf8-initial-results.html
[Data.Text]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text

The application used is a simple document store. Clients can store documents per
ID, and retrieve document ID's based on terms in the document. This blogpost is
written in Literate Haskell, feel free to grab the [raw version].

We use the `OverloadedStrings` language extension for general prettiness...

> {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

And then we have a whole lot of imports which you can skim right through.

> import Data.Char (isPunctuation)
> import Data.List (foldl')
> import Data.Monoid (mconcat)
> import Control.Applicative ((<$>))
> import Control.Concurrent.MVar (MVar, modifyMVar_, newMVar, readMVar)
> import Control.Monad.Reader (ReaderT, ask, runReaderT)
> import Control.Monad.Trans (liftIO)
> import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)

We will stick with simple `Map` and `Set` types for this benchmark.

> import Data.Map (Map)
> import Data.Set (Set)
> import Data.Text (Text)
> import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BC
> import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL
> import qualified Data.Map as M
> import qualified Data.Set as S
> import qualified Data.Text as T
> import qualified Data.Text.Encoding as T

We'll use [BlazeHTML] for some simple HTML rendering...

[BlazeHTML]: http://jaspervdj.be/blaze

> import Text.Blaze (Html, toHtml)
> import Text.Blaze.Renderer.Utf8 (renderHtml)
> import qualified Text.Blaze.Html5 as H

... and [Snap] as web application layer.

[Snap]: http://snapframework.com/

> import Snap.Types ( Snap, getParam, getRequestBody, modifyResponse, route
>                   , setContentType, writeLBS
>                   )
> import Snap.Http.Server (httpServe, defaultConfig)

The pure logic
--------------

Let's first write down the pure logic of our web application. When we receive a
document from a client, we want to extract the terms (i.e, words) used in the
document. This is why we have the `tokenize` function:

> tokenize :: Text -> [Text]
> tokenize =
>     filter (not . T.null) . map stripPunctuation . T.words . T.toLower
>   where
>     -- | Remove leading and trailing punctuation marks from a token
>     stripPunctuation =  T.dropWhileEnd isPunctuation . T.dropWhile isPunctuation

We'll use a simple type alias for the document store. For our benchmark, we
simply need a mapping from terms to document ID's, so that's exactly what we'll
represent using a `Map`.

> type Store = Map Text (Set Int)

And finally, we need to be able to at least add a new document to the `Store`.
The following function takes care of that, tokenizing the document and adding
the ID under each token in the `Map`.

> addDocument :: Int -> Text -> Store -> Store
> addDocument id' doc store = foldl' insert store $ tokenize doc
>   where
>     insert s t = M.insertWith' S.union t (S.singleton id') s

The web logic
-------------

Next up is some logic code for the web application layer. We first define the
type of our application:

> type App = ReaderT (MVar Store) Snap

That is, in addition the features which `Snap` provides, we also need access to
a shared `Store`. All of our web controllers have this type: let's look at the
controller which adds a document. The function is fairly straightforward, it
fetches the document ID and body, and adds it using `modifyMVar_`. Lastly, it
also shows a response to the client (we define the `blaze` auxiliary function
later).

> documentAdd :: App ()
> documentAdd = do
>     Just id' <- fmap (read . BC.unpack) <$> getParam "id"
>     doc <- T.decodeUtf8 . strict <$> getRequestBody
>     mvar <- ask
>     liftIO $ modifyMVar_ mvar $ return . addDocument id' doc
>     blaze $ documentView doc
>   where
>     strict = mconcat . BL.toChunks

We also want to be able to query the documents in our store. This isn't hard at
all, we can simply look in the `Map` to find the documents associated with the
given query.

> documentQuery :: App ()
> documentQuery = do
>     store <- liftIO . readMVar =<< ask
>     query <- fmap T.decodeUtf8 <$> getParam "query"
>     let results = fromMaybe S.empty $ flip M.lookup store =<< query
>     blaze $ resultsView results

Here, we have the auxiliary `blaze` function which is used to send some HTML to
the client.

> blaze :: Html -> App ()
> blaze html = do
>     modifyResponse $ setContentType "text/html; charset=UTF-8"
>     writeLBS $ renderHtml html

The web views
-------------

We also define some "templates" in order to show the different values to the
client. They are given here mostly for completeness.

> documentView :: Text -> Html
> documentView = H.p . toHtml

> resultsView :: Set Int -> Html
> resultsView = H.ul . mconcat . map (H.li . toHtml) . S.toList

Glueing it all together
-----------------------

What remains is some routing and a main function to glue it all together.

> app :: App ()
> app = route
>     [ ("/document/query/:query", documentQuery)
>     , ("/document/:id",            documentAdd)
>     ]

> main :: IO ()
> main = do
>     mvar <- newMVar M.empty
>     httpServe defaultConfig (runReaderT app mvar)

Results
-------

Next up is running it! I ran the application twice, once using the current
version of Text, and once using my UTF-8 based port. A client was simulated
which sent a large volume of twitter data in a variety of languages to the
server. The following graph represents memory usage over time:

Conclusions
-----------

While there is a very clear difference, it isn't as large as I first suspected.
This is caused by a number of reasons:

- we use a Text value per token in the document. There is an additional 6 words
  per value, causing a non-negligible overhead for the relatively small tokens;
- a lot of memory is taken up by `Set Int` as well;
- the internal structure of the `Map` also takes up 6 words per item.

That being said, I think the difference shows that UTF-8 clearly has some
benefits over UTF-16 in many situations. I'm looking forward to discussing more
of the possible advantages and disadvantages... perhaps at [CamHac]?
