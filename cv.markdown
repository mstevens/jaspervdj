## Projects

Here is a list of projects I have worked on in the past years.

- [JVGS] (2009) is an arty platform game that is not like the others. I
  implemented a subset of the [SVG specification] to give the game it's original
  look.

[SVG specification]: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/

- [Hakyll] (2009 - now): I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage, so I
  wrote [Hakyll], a static site generator in [Haskell].

- [BlazeHtml] (2010 - now) is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the
  [Haskell] programming language. I worked on this project for [Google Summer of
  Code] 2010.

- [Digestive functors] (2010 - now) is a general way of consuming input in
  [Haskell]. It can be used to generate HTML forms and parse the form input, as
  well as command-line applications.
