# Curriculum Vitae

This is a work in progress.

## Education

- Ghent University: Master in Computer Science: Software Engineering (in
  progress)
- Ghent University: Bachelor in Computer Science
- Secondary school: Sint-Lodewijkscollege Lokeren -- ASO, Latin & maths
  specialization
- Primary school: Stedelijke basisschool Lokeren -- afdeling Staakte

## Open source projects

Here is a list of projects I have worked on in the past years.

- [websockets] (2011): I created a library for easily writing robust
  WebSocket-capable servers in [Haskell].

[websockets]: http://github.com/jaspervdj/websockets

- [Snap Framework] (2011): I am an occasional contributor to this [Haskell] web
  framework.

[Snap Framework]: http://snapframework.com/

- [Text] (2011): I worked on the text library as a [Google Summer of Code]
  student, creating a port which uses UTF-8 internally, and doing extensive
  benchmarking to discover the tradeoffs between the different encodings.

[Text]: https://github.com/bos/text
[Google Summer of Code]: http://code.google.com/soc/

- [blaze-builder] (2010): Simon Meier and I developed an initial version of a
  fast builder monoid for the [BlazeHtml] project. This library is now used in
  many [Haskell] projects. Simon is the current maintainer.

- [BlazeHtml] (2010 - present) is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the
  [Haskell] programming language. I worked on this project for [Google Summer of
  Code] 2010.

- [Hakyll] (2009 - present): I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage, so I
  wrote [Hakyll], a static site generator in [Haskell].

[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

- [Digestive functors] (2010 - present) is a general way of consuming input in
  [Haskell]. It can be used to generate HTML forms and parse the form input, as
  well as command-line applications.

- [JVGS] (2009) is an arty platform game that is not like the others. I
  implemented a subset of the [SVG specification] to give the game it's original
  look.

## Work experience

- In the summer of 2011, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Amplidata]. The job
  involved extending their proprietary Distributed Storage System, which is
  written in [OCaml].
